# coffezy

1.Description of the application:

The name of the app is “Coffezy”. People will be able to order coffee on the go from this app from their desired location and can directly pick up their coffee without the need to wait for it. Coffezy saves time which people waste while waiting for their coffee. Coffezy aims to provide same service that are provided by the coffee shop to the people in more convenient way. For example: If a person wants to drink the coffee in the shop, it can be done by selecting the have here menu in Coffezy application. Coffezy allows the users to select coffee from multiple coffee shops and people can even compare the prices of the coffee by Coffezy application.
When people have the crave to have the coffee, they don’t need to roam around searching for coffee shops, the full version of Coffezy will have the ability to search the coffee shops around the user, this way user can easily select different varieties of coffee from different places and also navigate to the nearest coffee shops or the coffee shop which the user has over their coffee from. For the time being, we have statically implemented 5 coffee shop in the application along with 9 coffee items found in the shop. The users can only select these 5 given coffee shops for the time being and after the application is fully complete, user will be allowed to choose any coffee shop near them.  

2.Motivation

The target market for Coffezy are all coffee drinkers. As coffee is consumed by nearly half the population (46%), which is huge, hence the market is quite rich for coffee. On the other hand, we have not seen other apps like this, hence we decided to go ahead and make this app.
From the facts we know that people usually wait for 5 minutes for their coffee. This wait can extend to 20 minutes on busy days. People here in Australia don’t have that much of time. Hence, with this app they don’t have to wait. The coffee or other beverage is ready when they arrive at the store. People, who don’t get enough time to have or make coffee at home, can easily get their desired coffee from the store through the app. People who are driving can order coffee from the app and don’t have to hassle and make a call to the shop owner to make an order.
